Question 1:
The Student Performance Dataset is a dataset designed to examine the factors influencing academic
student performance. Based on the data available we want to find out the student’s performance given
some attribute values. Download the give dataset and perform the followings.
1. Identify the dependent and independent variables.
2. Read the dataset and do exploratory data analysis. (Data Preprocessing and meaningful
plots)).
3. Split the data set in train and test (80:20) ratio.
4. Write a python code for Linear Regression (from scratch) and train the model with training
data. (Only numpy and pandas should be used) 
5. Plot the loss vs epoch curve.
6. Give a student’s data – [Hours of study = 7, Previous score = 95, Extracurricular Activities =
Yes, Duration of Sleep = 7, Sample Question Papers Practiced = 6] then What will be his/her
performance based on your trained model.
7. Evaluate the model’s performance based on any two-performance metrics (at least 2) from
below on the test set – a.) MSE error b.) R2 Score c.) Adjusted R2 score (Only numpy and
pandas is allowed)



Question 2:
Take the same dataset and do it using regression library available in python. Analyse and compare
the result of your model (from scratch) vs library created model. Can you improve your model’s
performance and how?
Note: Include a single report for above questions. The report should be crisp and compact explaining
only the necessary details.
